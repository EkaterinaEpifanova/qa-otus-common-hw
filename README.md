# Python Learning Project

This repository contains a collection of simple Python scripts created as part of a learning journey in Python programming.

## ðŸ“š Contents

- The script `ps_report.py` runs ps aux, parses the output with Python's standard library, 
prints a system usage report (users, process counts, total CPU/memory, top consumers), 
and saves it to a timestamped TXT file.
- More scripts coming soon as learning progresses...

## âœ… Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- WSL or any Unix-based system

To run `ps_report.py` script on WSL or any Unix-based system:
```bash
python3 ps_report.py
